Notes for my brain for later

1. seems that can control time warp destination with "Warp.Destination" in scripts
2. line 890 in PlayerObject onward handles dropping out the warp timer
3. "PlayerObjectCollision" seems to be how objects know when sonic touches them
4. can use KeyPress.ButtonA/B/C to get granular controls.
